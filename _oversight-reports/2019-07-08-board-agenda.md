title: Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board Releases Inventory of Active Oversight Projects and Other Initiatives
date: July 08, 2019 
summary: The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board today released an inventory of its active oversight projects and other initiatives.  

Notably, the release discloses for the first time, after clearance by the agency, the subject of the Board’s “deep dive” review of a classified activity conducted by the NSA.  The inventory also describes several previously unannounced projects approved by the Board in early 2017.

Attaining the greatest possible transparency was one of the five “strategic goals” in the Board’s 2019-2022 Strategic Plan.  To achieve that goal, the Board committed in the Plan that it would “seek to identify publicly the subjects of its oversight reviews.”  This release fulfills that goal.  It reflects the Board’s commitment to giving the public and other stakeholders the greatest possible insight into the Board’s work, consistent with the need to protect classified information and with other applicable law.  The Board intends to update the inventory biannually.

A copy of the document accompanies this release.
