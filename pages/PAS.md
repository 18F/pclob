The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) issued a final ruling on January 3, 2017 amending the regulations implementing Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The amended regulations required federal agencies, as an affirmative obligation, to provide Personal Assistance Services (PAS), absent undue hardship, to individuals who need them due to a targeted disability, such as PTSD, epilepsy, or paralysis. PAS aids with performing activities of daily living that individuals would typically perform if they did not have a disability, such as eating and using the restroom. Agencies are only required to provide PAS when the individual is working or on work-related travel. PCLOB employees requesting PAS shall notify their supervisor and/or the Equal Opportunity Office, Reasonable Accommodation Coordinator to initiate the process. Any PLCOB applicant that has been selected for an interview requiring personal assistance services should contact Human Resources to initiate a reasonable accommodation request.
