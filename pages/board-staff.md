The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board is an independent executive branch agency led by a bipartisan group of five presidentially nominated and Senate-confirmed Board Members.

Helping the Board carry out its mission is the PCLOB staff, which presently comprises nearly twenty employees, including an executive director, a general counsel, a deputy general counsel, a chief information officer, a chief management officer, a public affairs and legislative affairs officer, staff attorneys, security and technology specialists, and administrative support staff.

Each Board Member has one attorney serving as his or her individual Counselor, while the remaining staff attorneys serve as Attorney-Advisors for the Board as a whole.
