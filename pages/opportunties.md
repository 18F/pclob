All full-time and part time employees of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board serve under excepted service, rather than the competitive service. Pursuant to Board policy, the Chairman determines the rate of pay or compensation for all Board employees in accordance with General Schedule (GS) standards and pay schedule, except that for certain senior positions, compensation may be set at any level up to the statutory maximum, even if that specific level is not reflected on the GS pay schedule. Under the Boardâ€™s authorizing statute, in no event may the rate of pay or employee compensation exceed the equivalent of that payable for a position of Level V of the Executive Schedule.
