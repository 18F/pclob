**WASHINGTON, DC** --  Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB) Chairman Adam Klein and Board Members Edward Felten and Jane Nitze have released the following joint statement on the passing of Patricia Wald, who served as a Board Member from 2012-2017:
 
***“We are very saddened to learn of the passing of Judge Patricia Wald. Over an extraordinarily distinguished legal and judicial career, she had a profound influence on so many. She was an inspiration through her work and her deep commitment to the Constitution and the rule of law.***
 
***“As one of the first group of Members to be confirmed to the PCLOB after Congress established the Board as an independent agency, Judge Wald was a highly respected voice for the protection of privacy and civil liberties. She asked tough questions and diligently pursued answers.***
 
***“During her service on the Board, Judge Wald participated in many significant oversight and advice projects, including the Board's oversight reports on the surveillance programs operated under Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act and Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The Board benefited greatly from her experience, thoughtful analysis, and wisdom.***
 
***“We are grateful for her decades of public service. Our thoughts are with her family, friends, and loved ones.”***
