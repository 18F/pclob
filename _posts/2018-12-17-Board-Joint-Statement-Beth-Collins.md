**PRIVACY AND CIVIL LIBERTIES OVERSIGHT BOARD STATEMENT ON DEPARTURE OF BOARD MEMBER ELISEBETH COLLINS**

**WASHINGTON, DC** - The Members of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight
Board (PCLOB) have released the following joint statement to mark the departure of longtime
Board Member Elisebeth Collins.
Board Member Collins departed the Board effective December 15, 2018.

*“We extend our enduring gratitude to our colleague Elisebeth Collins for her many years
of service to the Board. Board Member Collins is the longest-serving Member in the Board’s
history and has left an indelible imprint on the Board’s work and institutional development.
During her tenure, Board Member Collins participated in many significant oversight and advice
projects, including the Board’s oversight reports on the surveillance programs operated under
Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act and Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act. Board Member Collins’ deep expertise and incisive analysis on privacy, civil liberties, and
efforts to protect the nation against terrorism will be missed.*

*“Equally notable, however, are Board Member Collins’ contributions to the Board’s
institutional development. Beginning in February 2017, Board Member Collins was the Board’s
only remaining Senate-confirmed Member. In that capacity, Board Member Collins led the
Board ably through the ensuing sub-quorum period. Despite the limitations imposed by subquorum status, the Board continued to carry out its statutory oversight and advice functionsunder Member Collins’ leadership. In addition, Board Member Collins and Board staff
continued to advance the Board’s agency-building efforts and managed the Board’s relocation
to its new headquarters. These achievements have placed the Board on sound footing for longterm success.*

*“The Board will benefit from the legacy of Board Member Collins’ tenure for years to
come. We thank her for her long service and deep dedication to our agency.”*
