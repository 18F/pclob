*“The Board's existing oversight projects, including our examination of the NSA’s collection of call detail records under the USA Freedom Act and our review of the use of facial recognition in aviation security, will benefit from the energy and perspectives that incoming Members Bamzai and LeBlanc will bring to the Board’s work.
