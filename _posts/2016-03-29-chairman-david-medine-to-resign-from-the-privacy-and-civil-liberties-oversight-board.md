**WASHINGTON, DC**--David Medine, who chairs the independent, bipartisan Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB), has notified the White House of his intent to resign from the Board this summer. After leaving the Board, Chairman Medine will be working with a development organization, advising on data privacy and consumer protection for lower-income financial consumers in developing countries.

In a resignation statement, Chairman Medine said:

_“I have had the great privilege of being PCLOB’s first chairman. During my tenure and thanks to the support of the President and Congress, the Board has been able to carry out its timely mission of conducting oversight and providing advice to ensure that federal counterterrorism efforts properly balance national security with privacy and civil liberties._

_“I am grateful to have served alongside hardworking and thoughtful Board Members and staff who have demonstrated extraordinary talent and commitment in their diligent work to protect privacy and civil liberties. We have been full partners in the daunting challenge of starting a new federal agency at the same time as we were being called upon to address how this country can simultaneously protect its cherished values while ensuring national security._

_“I look forward to continuing to work on PCLOB’s current projects until my departure. I am pleased to know that, even after my departure, the Board Members and our dedicated staff remain committed to carrying forward the Board’s critical work, including its ongoing examination of counterterrorism activities under Executive Order 12333.”_

Chairman Medine has notified the White House that his resignation will be effective July 1, 2016\.
