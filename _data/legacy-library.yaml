    The PCLOB requests $23.3 million for its fiscal year (FY) 2016 budget
    request. This request represents an increase of $15.8 million over the
    Board’s FY 2015 budget. This change between FY 2015 and FY 2016 not only
    includes an increase of 12 positions, but is due primarily to a one-time
    increase of $13.2 million for the Board’s required physical move in 2016\.
    The funding requested for the 2016 move is a one-time expense which is
    required because the building housing the Board’s current office is being
    torn down, and the Board must move to a new location where it can handle
    classified information and operate in a Sensitive Compartmented Information
    Facility (SCIF).
