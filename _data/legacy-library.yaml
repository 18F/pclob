    U.S.C. § 2000ee-1, directs the privacy and civil liberties officers of eight
    federal agencies – and any additional agency designated by the Board – to
    submit periodic reports to the PCLOB regarding the reviews they have
    undertaken during the reporting period, the type of advice provided and the
    response given to such advice, and the number, nature, and disposition of
    the complaints received by the agency for alleged violations. The PCLOB’s

    efforts taken by the executive branch to protect the nation from terrorism
    are appropriately balanced with the need to protect privacy and civil

    The PCLOB requests $23.3 million for its fiscal year (FY) 2016 budget
    request. This request represents an increase of $15.8 million over the
    Board’s FY 2015 budget. This change between FY 2015 and FY 2016 not only
    includes an increase of 12 positions, but is due primarily to a one-time
    increase of $13.2 million for the Board’s required physical move in 2016\.
    The funding requested for the 2016 move is a one-time expense which is
    required because the building housing the Board’s current office is being
    torn down, and the Board must move to a new location where it can handle
    classified information and operate in a Sensitive Compartmented Information
    Facility (SCIF).
