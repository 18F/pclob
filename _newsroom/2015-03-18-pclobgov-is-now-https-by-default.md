## PCLOB.gov is Now HTTPS by Default

FOR RELEASE  
March 18, 2015

The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board’s (PCLOB) public website, PCLOB.gov, is now enabled for HTTPS encryption by default. This means that communication between a website visitor’s web browser and our web server will be encrypted and protected from eavesdropping. HTTPS (the “S” stands for secure) guarantees the connection between the website and the web server is secure and private. Visiting a website secured with HTTPS will display a lock icon within the web browser. PCLOB.gov joins WhiteHouse.gov, FTC.gov and FederalRegister.gov in adding this security feature for website visitors. You will now see a lock icon on our web pages indicating the communication is encrypted and private.

HTTPS not only encrypts the communication to prevent eavesdropping but provides integrity of the website content and privacy. HTTPS guarantees that visitors to PCLOB.gov are connecting to our official website and are not receiving content that may have been tampered with or entirely replaced while in transit. Encrypting browsing activity protects against eavesdropping, thus protecting the privacy of information showing which of our webpages were viewed, associated cookies, metadata and HTTP headers.
