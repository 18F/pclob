## Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board Comments on the Intelligence Community's Signals Intelligence Reform Anniversary Report

FOR RELEASE  
February 3, 2015

The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board welcomes the Administration's effort to provide greater transparency regarding government surveillance through the release of the Intelligence Community's [Signals Intelligence Reform Anniversary Report](http://icontherecord.tumblr.com/ppd-28/2015/overview).

The Board's [report on the surveillance program operated pursuant to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]({{site.baseurl}}/library/702-Report.pdf), issued in July 2014, called for the government to create and release, with minimal redactions, declassified versions of the current minimization procedures that govern the CIA's, FBI's and NSA's use of information collected under that program. The Administration, by today's public release of documents, has now fully implemented this recommendation. As explained in the Board's [Recommendations Assessment Report]({{site.baseurl}}/newsroom/20150129.html) issued last week, the Administration has accepted virtually all recommendations in the Board's Section 702 report and has made substantial progress toward implementing many of them, while also accepting most of the recommendations in the Board's January 2014 [report on the telephone records program conducted under Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act]({{site.baseurl}}/library/215-Report_on_the_Telephone_Records_Program.pdf). However, the Administration has not implemented the Board's recommendation to halt the NSA's bulk telephone records program, which it could do at any time without congressional involvement.

The Board also notes that today's release includes procedures under which the intelligence agencies will implement Presidential Policy Directive 28 on signals intelligence. PPD-28, issued in January 2014, describes protections to be provided to non-U.S. persons in the context of U.S. signals intelligence programs, and the directive includes a provision encouraging the Board to provide the President with a report assessing its implementation. The Board looks forward to continuing to work with the Intelligence Community to assess the privacy protections to be extended to non-U.S. persons under PPD-28.
