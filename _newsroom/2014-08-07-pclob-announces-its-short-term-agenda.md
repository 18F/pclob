At its public meeting on July 23, 2014, the Board announced its current short-term agenda. The issues announced are those the Board has already determined it will address. The Board is also continuing to examine additional issues for its future agenda, and welcomes public input on further topics to address.

The docket for official public comments on the Board's agenda closed on August 29, 2014\. Members of the public may email suggestions to the Board at info@pclob.gov. To view the comments that have been filed, [click here](http://www.regulations.gov/#%21docketDetail%3bD=PCLOB-2014-0001).

The Board announced plans to address the following issues in the near term:

*   **Presidential Policy Directive 28 (PPD-28):** PPD-28 includes a provision encouraging the Board to provide the President with a report assessing the implementation of this Directive on Signals Intelligence. The Directive discusses the protections to be provided to non-U.S. persons in the context of U.S. signals intelligence programs. The Board will work with the Intelligence Community to assess the privacy protections to be provided to non-U.S. persons.

*   **Training:** The Board will continue its work to assess and improve the privacy and civil liberties training programs provided by intelligence agencies. The Board has already begun to take an inventory of training materials used by the intelligence community. Taking a closer look at training will enable the Board to see how policies are being translated into action.

*   **Cybersecurity:** The President’s Executive Order 13636 on Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, issued in February 2013, calls upon the Department of Homeland Security to consult with the Board in assessing agency cybersecurity information sharing programs. The Board will consult with DHS and with Intelligence Community Civil Liberties Offices regarding cybersecurity policies and practices, as directed by the Order.

*   **Definition of Privacy:** The Board plans to engage in a public dialogue on what “privacy” means. The Board intends to host a public forum in the coming months in order to foster this discussion.

*   **Executive Order 12333 (EO 12333):** The Board will examine EO 12333 and its implications for privacy and civil liberties. EO 12333 establishes the framework that intelligence agencies must follow when conducting intelligence activities. The Board has already begun to work with the Intelligence Community in seeking updates to agency guidelines to reflect advances in technology. The Board is also beginning to explore how to approach and assess agency activities under EO 12333 to ensure the protection of civil liberties.

*   **Suspicious Activity Reports:** The Board will evaluate the functional standards used by state and local law enforcement agencies to report suspicious activity to fusion centers and the Intelligence Community.

*   **Efficacy:** The Board will work with agencies in the Intelligence Community to establish a methodology for evaluating the efficacy of counterterrorism programs.

*   **803 Reports:** The Board will consider possible changes to reporting under Section 803 in order to make the information gathered more meaningful. Currently, eight federal agencies are required to submit 803 reports to the Board. These reports contain information on the number of internal and public complaints, the nature of complaints, and the response that resulted.
