Travis LeBlanc is a Board Member of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board.  He is also vice chair of Cooley's cyber/data/privacy practice, and is a leading authority on cybersecurity, data privacy, telecommunications and the regulation of emerging and disruptive technologies.  The respect and skills Travis earned during his career have translated into appointments and recommendations across political spectrums, including his selection by the US Department of Commerce and the European Commission as an arbitrator for the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework in 2017 and his presidential nomination to the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board. 
 
Travis was chief of the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) Enforcement Bureau during the Obama administration, where he spearheaded hundreds of enforcement actions involving consumer issues such as false advertising and the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), unfair competition, regulatory compliance and fraud, waste and abuse of government programs. He has also worked closely with senior officials at other federal, state and international agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), Department of Justice (DOJ), all 50 state attorneys general and data protection authorities across the globe.
 
Travis previously served as a senior adviser to former California Attorney General Kamala D. Harris and as special assistant attorney general of California, where he oversaw California’s complex litigation and policy in areas such as technology regulation, high-tech crime, cybersecurity, privacy, intellectual property, antitrust, healthcare, telecommunications and human trafficking. Prior to this high-profile California role, he served during the Obama administration as an attorney-adviser in the US Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel, which advises the president, attorney general and executive branch agencies on the constitutionality and legality of the programs and activities of the US government.
