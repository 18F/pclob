# We're setting a baseurl here for development to ensure that
# all our URLs on the actual site use {{ site.baseurl }} rather
# than assuming the site is rooted at "/". This will ensure that
# federalist branch builds, which are never rooted at "/", have no
# 404s.
#
# During production, the "real" baseurl will be passed in through
# the command-line, overriding the following value.
baseurl: "/dev"

url: "https://pclob.gov" # the base hostname & protocol for your site
