						The PCLOB’s Strategic Plan for 2016 – 2018 establishes four strategic goals to support the agency’s mission and guide its efforts through 2018.  These cover the Board’s oversight reviews; its advice to the President and other elements of the executive branch; its strategies to inform Congress, the President, and the public; and the Board’s continued focus on refining the agency’s own capabilities and internal procedures.

						The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (“PCLOB” or the “Board”) requests $8 million (and no new positions) for its FY 2018 Budget Request. The PCLOB’s FY 2018 Request will allow the PCLOB to continue fulfilling its mission requirements: to conduct oversight and provide advice to ensure that efforts taken by the executive branch to protect the nation from terrorism are appropriately balanced with the need to protect privacy and civil liberties, while operating as an established agency with a growing infrastructure and increasingly comprehensive operating policies and procedures.

						The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (“PCLOB” or the “Board”) requests $10,081 thousand (and no new positions) for its fiscal year (“FY”) 2017 budget request. This request would sustain the funding level set in the Board’s FY 2016 budget request with no requested increase to resources. The FY 2017 budget will allow the Board to continue its statutory mission: to conduct oversight and provide advice to ensure that efforts taken by the executive branch to protect the Nation from terrorism are appropriately balanced with the need to protect privacy and civil liberties.

							<strong>PCLOB FY 2016 Budget Request</strong> (<a href="library/CBJB16.pdf">Download</a>) <br/>
						The PCLOB requests $23.3 million for its fiscal year (FY) 2016 budget request. This request represents an increase of $15.8 million over the Board’s FY 2015 budget. This change between FY 2015 and FY 2016 not only includes an increase of 12 positions, but is due primarily to a one-time increase of $13.2 million for the Board’s required physical move in 2016. The funding requested for the 2016 move is a one-time expense which is required because the building housing the Board’s current office is being torn down, and the Board must move to a new location where it can handle classified information and operate in a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF).
